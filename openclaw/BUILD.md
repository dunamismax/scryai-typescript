# BUILD.md

**Current status:** phase = heartbeat config + doc drift cleanup complete · last updated = 2026-03-08 10:22 America/New_York · latest relevant focus = heartbeat direct-policy is now explicit, canonical docs were reconciled to the live OpenClaw 2026.3.7 install/channel posture, mirror audit is clean, and a fresh encrypted backup checkpoint has been prepared for push to `scry-home`

## Phase plan

### Phase 1 — Audit
- [x] Read canonical identity and operating files
- [x] Check runtime/session status
- [x] Inspect cron health at a high level
- [x] Identify missing, stale, or contradictory workspace docs
- [x] Pull external best-practice references for agent operating manuals/orchestration

### Phase 2 — Improvements to apply directly
- [x] Create missing bootstrap/startup guidance
- [x] Tighten AGENTS.md routing, reporting, verification, and memory hygiene rules
- [x] Tighten SOUL.md judgment/personality/ownership guidance without sanding off existing strengths
- [x] Fix stale references in workspace notes
- [x] Add/update durable memory only if the change is truly long-lived
- [x] Add today's daily memory entry

### Phase 3 — Verify
- [x] Re-read changed files for consistency
- [x] Confirm no cron failures were introduced or left unreported
- [x] Reconcile BUILD.md with actual workspace state

## Verification snapshot

- Session/runtime check: `session_status` confirms OpenClaw 2026.3.3 on `openai-codex/gpt-5.4`, healthy active session, current time 2026-03-07 08:57 EST.
- Cron health snapshot: 11 jobs listed; no failing/stuck jobs observed in the returned scheduler state. Recent jobs with state data showed `lastStatus: ok`.
- Workspace doc consistency: re-read `SOUL.md`, `AGENTS.md`, `BOOTSTRAP.md`, `IDENTITY.md`, `TOOLS.md`, `HEARTBEAT.md`, and `MEMORY.md` after edits; changes are internally consistent.
- 2026-03-07 doc refresh: canonical `SOUL.md`, `AGENTS.md`, and `CLAUDE.md` updated from reviewed `improved_files` proposals, with stale bench guidance filtered out.
- Specialist inheritance refresh: `scripts/tasks/harden_specialists.py` rebuilt to generate upgraded specialist `SOUL.md` / `AGENTS.md` / `CLAUDE.md` baselines plus stronger smoke enforcement.
- Specialist verification: `uv run python -m scripts specialists:harden` ✅ and all six `scripts/specialist-weekly-smoke.sh` runs ✅ at 10/10 across protocol, verification, and attribution.
- Mirror propagation: `cd ~/github/scry-home && uv run python -m scripts sync:openclaw` ✅ copied updated root and `openclaw/` mirror docs.
- Rename drift cleanup: canonical `TOOLS.md`, `MEMORY.md`, specialist mirrored `TOOLS.md`, live cron jobs, repo cron mirror, and the installed OpenClaw backup LaunchAgent now point at `scry-home` instead of `grimoire`.
- Audit verification: `cd ~/github/scry-home && uv run python -m scripts openclaw:audit` ✅ now passes after excluding historical `runs/` from mirror/path checks and skipping stale-path checks for `memory/` history logs.
- Known drift repaired: missing `BOOTSTRAP.md`, missing `BUILD.md`, stale `TOOLS.md` reference to a workspace-local `CONTRIBUTING_TO_OPENCLAW.md`.

### Phase 4 — Propagation
- [x] Run `specialists:harden` to deploy updated templates/hooks/smoke to specialist workspaces
- [x] Run `sync:openclaw` to mirror canonical workspace into `scry-home`
- [x] Run `openclaw:audit` to verify full-stack consistency
- [x] Run `cron:reconcile --scope=all --apply` to converge all manifest jobs

### Phase 5 — Audit fix
- [x] Diagnose false-positive path checks in `openclaw:audit`
- [x] Patch trailing-whitespace / markdown-punctuation trimming in path extraction
- [x] Exclude historical `runs/` from mirror/path drift checks and skip stale-path validation for `memory/` history logs
- [x] Re-run `openclaw:audit`

### Phase 6 — Agent roster cutover
- [x] Replace the old bench (`reviewer`, `builder-mobile`, `openclaw-maintainer`, `contributor`) with the new bench (`scribe`, `research`, `operator`) in live config and docs
- [x] Rework specialist workspaces so all active agents share Scry-aligned soul/voice with domain-specific AGENTS/CLAUDE overlays
- [x] Update Discord channel routing to the final 7-channel roster
- [x] Reconcile cron/sync/hardening automation with the new active specialist list
- [x] Verify new agents are live and reachable

### Phase 7 — Canonical doc refresh from `improved_files`
- [x] Review proposed `SOUL`, `AGENTS`, and `CLAUDE` rewrites against live workspace docs
- [x] Merge worthwhile improvements without reintroducing stale bench/runtime guidance
- [x] Update canonical workspace docs and repo-root `CLAUDE.md`
- [x] Run `sync:openclaw` so repo-root and `openclaw/` mirror copies match the live workspace

### Phase 8 — Specialist bench inheritance refresh
- [x] Rebuild `specialists:harden` so it writes upgraded specialist `SOUL.md`, `AGENTS.md`, and `CLAUDE.md` baselines instead of only hook boilerplate
- [x] Reapply hardening across all active specialists: `codex-orchestrator`, `sentinel`, `scribe`, `research`, `luma`, `operator`
- [x] Fix the generated smoke-script quoting/scoring bug uncovered during verification
- [x] Re-run specialist weekly smokes; all six active specialists now pass 10/10 across protocol, verification, and attribution
- [x] Sync refreshed specialist workspaces back into the `scry-home` mirror

### Phase 9 — 2026-03-07 runtime/workspace audit
- [x] Re-check live `openclaw status`
- [x] Re-run `openclaw:audit` to identify mirror/path drift
- [x] Identify stale context sources and dead paths in workspace docs/templates
- [x] Remove the stale `CallRift` prompt from `workspace/prompts`
- [x] Repair the codex-orchestrator repo-review output path
- [x] Rewrite stale Sentinel durable memory to current reality
- [x] Sync workspace/specialist changes back into `scry-home`
- [x] Re-run `openclaw:audit` after sync to confirm the remaining drift is gone

### Audit snapshot — 2026-03-07 16:58 ET
- `openclaw status` shows the gateway healthy on 2026.3.3 with 7 active agents and 8 active sessions.
- Security audit is clean of criticals, but still warns about (1) untrusted reverse-proxy headers if the Control UI is ever proxied and (2) the personal-assistant runtime being reachable by multiple users if Discord group access is treated as shared/untrusted.
- `openclaw:audit` found real drift before cleanup: unsynced root/mirror markdown, a stale CallRift repo path in an old workspace prompt, and a dead repo-review output directory in the codex-orchestrator template.
- Sentinel's old `MEMORY.md` was materially stale: wrong default model, old Signal-only comms posture, old repo inventory, and outdated reference-doc location.
- Inactive legacy specialist workspaces from the old Claude/Codex era were removed. Codex-orchestrator run artifacts were trimmed to the current useful set.
- Memory search anomaly was root-caused and fixed: without an embedding provider, OpenClaw intentionally skipped file/session sync entirely in FTS-only mode. Local Ollama embeddings (`nomic-embed-text`) are now configured and the index was rebuilt successfully.
- `openclaw status` now reports populated memory (`11 files · 39 chunks`) and `openclaw memory status --deep` shows ready vector + FTS indexing across all active agents.

### Phase 10 — Discord infrastructure cutover
- [x] Audit the live Discord server layout and existing thread sprawl
- [x] Decide on durable channel-based architecture instead of permanent-thread sprawl
- [x] Create `Agents` and `Workspaces` categories plus durable workspace channels
- [x] Rebind all new workspace channels in OpenClaw config and restart cleanly
- [x] Delete the obsolete seeded threads so only the new architecture remains
- [x] Verify gateway health plus zero remaining threads under the agent home channels

### Discord cutover snapshot — 2026-03-07 18:58 ET
- Durable structure is now **channels for homes/workspaces, threads only for short-lived branches**.
- `Agents` now holds the seven home channels: `scry`, `codex`, `research`, `scribe`, `operator`, `sentinel`, `luma`.
- `Workspaces` now holds the durable scoped lanes: `codex-lab`, `codex-shipyard`, `codex-review-desk`, `codex-bug-hunt`, `research-market-radar`, `research-deep-dive`, `research-kill-or-pursue`, `scribe-draft-room`, `scribe-docs-distillery`, `operator-ops-watch`, `operator-openclaw-ops`, `operator-automation-yard`, `sentinel-security-audit`, `luma-shot-lab`.
- OpenClaw config was patched so every new workspace channel is explicitly allowlisted and bound to the correct agent.
- Verification: `openclaw status` stayed healthy after restart, and Discord `thread-list` now returns zero threads under `#scry`, `#codex`, `#research`, `#scribe`, `#operator`, `#sentinel`, and `#luma`.

### Phase 11 — OpenClaw runtime backup hardening
- [x] Audit what `scry-home` sync covers versus what live `~/.openclaw` state it misses
- [x] Identify and fix the live backup-runner failure after repo/tooling drift
- [x] Expand encrypted backup scope to include high-value OpenClaw runtime state (`agents`, `memory`, `subagents`, `cron`, `delivery-queue`)
- [x] Generate and verify a fresh encrypted runtime-inclusive artifact
- [x] Reload the LaunchAgent and verify scheduled backup health (`last exit code = 0`)
- [x] Push the repaired backup flow + fresh encrypted artifact off-machine through private GitHub + Codeberg remotes

### Backup hardening snapshot — 2026-03-07 19:12 ET
- `scry-home` backup automation now captures the important OpenClaw working-brain state, not just mirrored docs/config.
- The live runner failure was repaired by fixing launchd-safe path handling and explicit repo CLI invocation from the backup script.
- Fresh encrypted artifact created at `~/github/scry-home/vault/config/critical-configs.tar.enc` with restore verification passing against session + memory requirements.
- `launchctl print gui/$(id -u)/com.scry.openclaw.backup` now reports `last exit code = 0` after reload.
- Off-machine publication succeeded to both private remotes; current artifact size is ~96 MB, so future migration to a dedicated blob backup target is still the cleaner long-term path.

### Phase 12 — Discord workspaces vs custom skills rollback
- [x] Restore Discord workspace channel bindings/allowlist after the temporary home-only cutover
- [x] Confirm no workspace channels were deleted during the reversal
- [x] Remove the custom shared skills that were created during the experiment
- [x] Keep the reusable OpenClaw bug prompt as markdown under `workspace/prompts/`
- [x] Revert workspace/sync-memory drift that implied a shared-skills rollout was the new default

### Rollback snapshot — 2026-03-07 19:59 ET
- The Discord server remains on the channel-plus-workspaces architecture; no workspace channels were deleted.
- The temporary config cutover to home-channels-only was reverted and full workspace bindings were restored.
- Custom shared skills created during the experiment were removed.
- Historical note: at that point the OpenClaw mergeable bug scout prompt still existed as a standalone markdown file in the old flat prompt layout.

### Phase 13 — Prompt library expansion for the Discord bench
- [x] Audit the current prompt directory and existing reusable prompt style
- [x] Review the active specialist bench and mirrored specialist files
- [x] Review the live Discord agent/workspace channel layout and lane topics
- [x] Draft a broader reusable prompt pack aligned to the current lanes
- [x] Add a prompt index so future routing is obvious
- [x] Sync the updated prompt library into `scry-home`
- [x] Run repo verification relevant to the mirrored prompt changes
- [x] Commit the prompt-library expansion cleanly

### Prompt library snapshot — 2026-03-07 20:24 ET
- The prompt library now mirrors the current Discord architecture instead of carrying only a single bug-hunt prompt.
- New reusable prompts were added for orchestration, Codex ship/lab/review flows, Research deep-dive/market/decision work, Scribe drafting/docs distillation, Operator OpenClaw ops/automation/incidents, Sentinel security audits, and Luma creative treatment work.
- `README.md` now acts as a quick index for future prompt selection.
- `uv run python -m scripts sync:openclaw` ✅ propagated the new prompt pack into `~/github/scry-home/openclaw/prompts/openclaw/`.
- `bun run lint` ✅ passed in `~/github/scry-home`.
- `uv run python -m scripts openclaw:audit` ✅ passed after creating the intended local worktree root at `~/.openclaw/worktrees`, which existing codex-orchestrator docs already referenced.
- Local repo commits were created in `~/github/scry-home` for the prompt-library expansion; the working tree still contains unrelated pre-existing mirror noise outside this task.

### Phase 14 — Specialist prompt locality + bootstrap ceiling
- [x] Add a durable local mirror of shared OpenClaw prompt files inside specialist workspaces so file reads stay within sandbox roots
- [x] Teach specialist baselines to prefer local prompt mirrors instead of the `scry-home` export path
- [x] Trim canonical `AGENTS.md` below the injected-context ceiling and verify the new size
- [x] Re-run hardening/sync verification after the fixes

### Follow-up snapshot — 2026-03-07 20:56 ET
- Canonical `AGENTS.md` is now `19,943` bytes, below the 20,000-byte injected bootstrap ceiling that previously caused truncation.
- `scripts/tasks/harden_specialists.py` now mirrors the shared `workspace/prompts/openclaw/` pack into each specialist workspace at `prompts/openclaw/` and adds an explicit local-path rule to specialist `CLAUDE.md` hardening guidance.
- `uv run python -m scripts specialists:harden` ✅ applied the prompt-locality baseline across all six active specialists; a targeted rerun for `codex-orchestrator` restored its issue-lane-specific overlays after the generic pass.
- Historical note: at that point the live codex-orchestrator workspace still carried the old standalone mergeable-bug prompt plus the related shared prompt pack locally.
- `uv run python -m scripts sync:openclaw` ✅ mirrored the updated canonical + specialist files back into `~/github/scry-home`.
- `uv run python -m scripts openclaw:audit` ✅ passed after the final sync.

### Phase 15 — Discord workspaces retirement + thread-first prompt rebuild
- [x] Remove dead Discord workspace bindings from live OpenClaw config so only the seven home channels remain allowlisted/bound
- [x] Retire the Discord `Workspaces` category and its scoped channels (user completed the server-side deletion directly)
- [x] Reorganize the canonical prompt pack into per-agent folders for thread-first use
- [x] Sync the rebuilt prompt pack into `scry-home`
- [x] Run prompt/config verification after the Discord cleanup
- [x] Commit the canonical workspace changes and the mirrored `scry-home` changes cleanly

### Phase 15 snapshot — 2026-03-07 21:10 ET
- The old `Workspaces` category and its scoped Discord channels are now gone from the server; Stephen deleted the server-side channels directly.
- Live OpenClaw config has been cleaned so `bindings` target only `#scry`, `#codex`, `#research`, `#scribe`, `#operator`, `#sentinel`, and `#luma`, and the Discord guild allowlist now contains only those seven home-channel IDs.
- The canonical prompt pack under `workspace/prompts/openclaw/` has been rebuilt into per-agent folders (`scry/`, `codex/`, `research/`, `scribe/`, `operator/`, `sentinel/`, `luma/`) with thread-first starter prompts.
- This phase supersedes the earlier channel-plus-workspaces experiment documented above.

### Phase 16 — Prompt-library refinement + OpenClaw upstream prompts
- [x] Re-read the canonical prompt library and current README before changing anything
- [x] Audit the pack for naming, overlap, workflow fit, and weak prompt content
- [x] Tighten the README so prompt selection is obvious and thread-first
- [x] Refine the weaker prompts for consistency and sharper operating guidance
- [x] Add OpenClaw-upstream-specific prompts for Scry, Codex, and Research
- [x] Run propagation + required verification (`specialists:harden`, `sync:openclaw`, `bun run lint`, `openclaw:audit`)
- [x] Commit the canonical workspace changes and mirrored `scry-home` changes cleanly

### Phase 16 snapshot — 2026-03-07 21:45 ET
- `prompts/openclaw/README.md` now acts like a real chooser: thread-first operating model, quick-start table, explicit OpenClaw upstream flow, tighter naming rules, and short descriptions for every prompt.
- New upstream prompts added: `scry/thread-openclaw-upstream-pr-strategy.md`, `codex/thread-openclaw-upstream-mergeable-fix.md`, `codex/thread-openclaw-upstream-pr-polish.md`, and `research/thread-openclaw-upstream-issue-radar.md`.
- Existing prompts were tightened for consistency with the home-channel + new-thread workflow, especially routing/orchestration wording and several prompts whose opening line no longer explicitly pointed at the agent home channel.
- Manual consistency pass: re-read the changed README plus the changed prompt files after the rewrite.
- Verification: `uv run python -m scripts specialists:harden` ✅, `uv run python -m scripts sync:openclaw` ✅, `bun run lint` ✅, `uv run python -m scripts openclaw:audit` ✅.
- Sync cleaned up two stale mirror-only Codex upstream prompt filenames in `scry-home` (`thread-openclaw-upstream-bug-hunt.md`, `thread-openclaw-upstream-issue-executor.md`) so the mirror now matches the canonical pack.

### Phase 17 — Discord prompt pin + canonical doc final pass
- [x] Re-read the current prompt README and canonical workspace docs before changing anything
- [x] Add a pin-ready Discord chooser for the thread-first prompt workflow
- [x] Wire that chooser into the canonical prompt pack so it is easy to find and keep current
- [x] Make the final pass on `MEMORY.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, `AGENTS.md`, and `SOUL.md`; update only what truly changed
- [x] Re-run propagation + verification for the affected docs/prompts
- [x] Post the pin-ready chooser into Discord and pin it
- [x] Commit the canonical workspace changes and mirrored `scry-home` changes cleanly

### Phase 17 snapshot — 2026-03-07 22:02 ET
- Added a pin-ready chooser at `prompts/openclaw/DISCORD_PINNED_QUICKSTART.md` and linked it from `prompts/openclaw/README.md` so the short Discord version and full chooser are both first-class.
- Posted that chooser into `#scry` and pinned it as message `1480033679408627762`.
- `CLAUDE.md` now treats the shared prompt library as canonical workspace material and explicitly says to keep `README.md` + `DISCORD_PINNED_QUICKSTART.md` aligned.
- `MEMORY.md` now records the durable rule that prompt-pack routing changes require updating both chooser files together and re-running sync/hardening.
- `AGENTS.md` was reviewed and the existing clarity edits remain current; `SOUL.md` was reviewed and left unchanged.
- Verification: re-read the changed chooser/docs manually, then ran `uv run python -m scripts specialists:harden` ✅, `uv run python -m scripts sync:openclaw` ✅, `bun run lint` ✅, and `uv run python -m scripts openclaw:audit` ✅.

### Phase 18 — Discord home-channel pinned note split
- [x] Inspect the live Discord home-channel pins and confirm the generic note drift
- [x] Create canonical per-channel pinned-note source files under the prompt pack
- [x] Update chooser/docs so the global overview is no longer treated as the live pin source
- [x] Sync / harden the updated prompt pack and re-run verification
- [x] Replace or add the live pinned note in each agent home channel so each one matches its own prompt set
- [x] Commit the canonical workspace changes and mirrored `scry-home` changes cleanly

### Phase 18 snapshot — 2026-03-07 22:36 ET
- Added canonical per-channel pinned-note source files under `prompts/openclaw/discord-pins/` for `#scry`, `#codex`, `#research`, `#scribe`, `#operator`, `#sentinel`, and `#luma`.
- Reframed `prompts/openclaw/DISCORD_PINNED_QUICKSTART.md` as a global overview only, and updated `prompts/openclaw/README.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, and `MEMORY.md` so live home-channel pins now point at the per-channel source files instead of one shared generic note.
- Updated the live Discord home-channel pinned notes: edited existing pins in `#scry` (`1480033679408627762`), `#codex` (`1480037066267168911`), and `#research` (`1480037069207240846`); created and pinned new customized notes in `#scribe` (`1480046027896651888`), `#operator` (`1480046029750407300`), `#sentinel` (`1480046031356952779`), and `#luma` (`1480046033177284678`).
- Verification: re-read the changed chooser / overview / per-channel pin files manually; `uv run python -m scripts specialists:harden` ✅, `uv run python -m scripts sync:openclaw` ✅, `bun run lint` ✅, `uv run python -m scripts openclaw:audit` ✅; `message list-pins` confirmed the final live pin state across all seven home channels.
- Commits: workspace and `scry-home` were both committed cleanly with message `Split Discord home-channel pinned notes`.

### Phase 19 — Specialist identity polish + cron manifest reconcile
- [x] Replace append-only specialist identity hardening with real per-agent `IDENTITY.md` templates
- [x] Re-harden all six active specialist workspaces so the new identity files land live
- [x] Run `cron:reconcile --scope=all --apply`
- [x] Re-sync specialist mirrors and re-run verification (`bun run lint`, `openclaw:audit`, specialist weekly smokes)
- [x] Reconcile `BUILD.md` with the new live state

### Phase 19 snapshot — 2026-03-07 23:31 ET
- `scripts/tasks/harden_specialists.py` now owns full specialist-specific `IDENTITY.md` generation via a new `IDENTITY_PROFILES` map instead of only appending shared verification/attribution footer lines.
- All six active specialist workspaces were re-hardened successfully; sync mirrored the refreshed identity files into `scry-home/openclaw/specialists/`.
- `uv run python -m scripts cron:reconcile --scope=all --apply` reported **no drift detected** across the managed cron manifest (`scope: all`, `8 managed jobs`, `16 live jobs total`).
- Verification: `uv run python -m py_compile scripts/tasks/harden_specialists.py` ✅, `uv run python -m scripts specialists:harden` ✅, `uv run python -m scripts sync:openclaw` ✅, `bun run lint` ✅, `uv run python -m scripts openclaw:audit` ✅, and all six `specialist-weekly-smoke.sh` runs ✅ at 10/10.
- Sync noise note: `sync:openclaw` also refreshed `openclaw/exec-approvals.json` in the mirror from live runtime state; treat that as incidental unless explicitly included in a later commit.

### Phase 20 — OpenClaw 2026.3.7 backup + update
- [x] Inspect live runtime status, update availability, and backup posture before changing anything
- [x] Sync canonical workspace state into `scry-home`
- [x] Refresh the encrypted runtime backup artifact and push the checkpoint to both remotes
- [x] Diagnose the updater path mismatch and choose a safe manual package-install flow
- [x] Update the live install to 2026.3.7, run doctor, restart, and verify gateway health

### Phase 20 snapshot — 2026-03-08 10:14 ET
- Preflight confirmed the gateway was healthy on **2026.3.3**, `openclaw update status` showed **2026.3.7** available on the stable channel, and the backup LaunchAgent reported `last exit code = 0`.
- `uv run python -m scripts sync:openclaw` refreshed the `scry-home` mirror, including the durable contributor-memory addition plus current cron/approval state.
- `./scripts/ops/daily-openclaw-backup.sh` produced a fresh encrypted runtime backup artifact, and `scry-home` was committed/pushed to both GitHub and Codeberg as `23d13f5` (`Backup OpenClaw state before 2026.3.7 update`).
- The control-plane updater and `openclaw update` both skipped because this machine uses a **custom-prefix package install** at `~/.openclaw`, not a git checkout and not a globally detectable npm/pnpm prefix.
- Safe manual workaround used: `npm i -g openclaw@2026.3.7 --prefix /Users/sawyer/.openclaw --no-fund --no-audit --loglevel=error`, followed by `openclaw doctor --non-interactive` and a gateway restart.
- Verification: `openclaw --version` ✅ `2026.3.7`; `openclaw status --deep` ✅ gateway healthy, Discord OK, app `2026.3.7`; `openclaw update status` ✅ no update available, stable channel still set.
- Follow-up completed immediately after: the gateway LaunchAgent no longer embeds `OPENCLAW_GATEWAY_TOKEN`; the old doctor warning about reinstalling the service disappeared.
- Remaining expected warning from that pass: the personal-assistant/multi-user heuristic for the private Discord deployment.

### Phase 21 — heartbeat direct-policy + stale-doc cleanup
- [x] Inspect heartbeat config schema and current config before editing
- [x] Pin `agents.defaults.heartbeat.directPolicy` explicitly to preserve current behavior across upgrades
- [x] Correct stale install/channel/auth notes in canonical workspace docs (`TOOLS.md`, `MEMORY.md`)
- [x] Re-harden/sync specialist mirrors, rerun audit, and confirm drift is gone
- [x] Run a fresh encrypted OpenClaw backup and push `scry-home` checkpoint
- [x] Re-run doctor/status verification and reconcile final notes

### Phase 21 snapshot — 2026-03-08 10:22 ET
- Ran `gateway config.schema.lookup` on `agents.defaults.heartbeat`, confirmed `directPolicy` supports `allow|block`, and patched the live config to set `directPolicy: 'allow'` using `config.patch` with the current `baseHash`.
- Follow-up verification: `openclaw doctor --non-interactive` no longer reports the heartbeat direct-policy warning, and the earlier gateway-service token warning also remains gone.
- Reconciled canonical docs to reality: `TOOLS.md` now reflects the custom-prefix package install at `~/.openclaw`, the `~/.local/bin/openclaw` wrapper path, and the correct manual fallback update flow; `MEMORY.md` now reflects the live runtime package install, OAuth auth profiles, Discord-primary / Signal-disabled channel posture, and current local OpenClaw layout.
- Ran `uv run python -m scripts specialists:harden` so shared TOOLS/identity changes propagated to all six specialist workspaces, then `uv run python -m scripts sync:openclaw` to refresh the `scry-home` mirror.
- `uv run python -m scripts openclaw:audit` now passes cleanly; the earlier codex-orchestrator specialist mirror drift was resolved by the sync.
- `./scripts/ops/daily-openclaw-backup.sh` produced a fresh encrypted runtime backup artifact at 10:17 ET, ready for the next `scry-home` checkpoint commit/push.
- Verification: `openclaw status --deep` ✅ gateway healthy on `2026.3.7`, Discord OK; `openclaw doctor --non-interactive` ✅ no heartbeat/service-token warning; `openclaw security audit --deep` unchanged except for the expected private-Discord personal-assistant warning.

## Immediate next pass priorities

1. If desired, move rotating encrypted runtime backup blobs out of normal git history and onto a dedicated backup target (restic/B2/S3/NAS) while keeping `scry-home` as the control plane/manifest.
2. If desired, do a second-pass personality polish on specialist `SOUL.md` voice anchors now that `IDENTITY.md` is properly template-managed.
3. Optionally prune incidental mirror churn like `openclaw/exec-approvals.json` from future content-focused commits.
