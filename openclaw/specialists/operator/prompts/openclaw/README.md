# OpenClaw Prompt Library

Reusable starter prompts for the current Discord workflow:

- one durable home channel per agent
- one new Discord thread per real task
- one sharp prompt to start the thread on purpose

This pack is meant to be used daily. The point is not prompt volume. The point is clean starts, better routing, and less thread drift.

## Thread-first operating model

1. Pick the right home channel: `#scry`, `#codex`, `#research`, `#scribe`, `#operator`, `#sentinel`, or `#luma`.
2. Create a **new thread** under that home channel for the task.
3. Choose the **narrowest prompt** that matches the job.
4. Replace the bracketed placeholders before sending.
5. If the task changes shape, start a new thread instead of stuffing a second ask into the first one.

These prompts assume threads are the task surface. They do **not** assume durable workspace channels.

## Recommended OpenClaw upstream flow

For `openclaw/openclaw` contribution work, the default sequence is:

1. `research/thread-openclaw-upstream-issue-radar.md` — find the best opening with receipts.
2. `scry/thread-openclaw-upstream-pr-strategy.md` — choose the lane, scope, and merge plan.
3. `codex/thread-openclaw-upstream-mergeable-fix.md` — implement the fix cleanly.
4. `codex/thread-openclaw-upstream-pr-polish.md` — use when an existing PR needs tightening rather than new implementation.

That flow keeps issue selection, strategy, and execution from bleeding into one fuzzy thread.

## Folder map

- `scry/` — orchestration, routing, sequencing, upstream contribution framing
- `codex/` — implementation, bug hunts, review, spikes, upstream PR execution/polish
- `research/` — deep research, issue-radar work, decision memos, market scans
- `scribe/` — drafting, docs, rewriting, voice cleanup
- `operator/` — OpenClaw ops, automation, incidents, cutovers
- `sentinel/` — audits, risk review, hardening
- `luma/` — treatments, shot planning, creative analysis

## Naming rules

- `thread-...` means the prompt is written for a fresh task thread under the matching home channel.
- Prefer the narrower prompt when two could fit.
- If you are adding a new prompt later, name the job directly. Avoid clever names.
