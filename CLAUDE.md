## Repo-Specific Notes

- CLI entrypoint: `scripts/cli.ts` → all tasks under `scripts/tasks/`.
- Run `bun run scry:doctor` to verify prerequisites and project health.
- Run `bun run lint && bun run typecheck` before committing.
- Use `bun run scry:sync:remotes -- --fix` to configure dual push remotes on new repos.
- The `openclaw/` directory is auto-synced from the OpenClaw workspace. Do not edit files there directly.
- The `vault/` directory contains encrypted backups. Never commit decrypted secrets.
- SOUL.md and AGENTS.md at repo root are synced from the OpenClaw workspace (canonical source). Edits here get overwritten on next sync.
