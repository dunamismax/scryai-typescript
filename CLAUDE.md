## Tech Stack (Mandatory -- No Exceptions)

### Infrastructure & Platform

| Layer | Tool | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| **Platform** | Ubuntu 24.04 LTS, Docker, Docker Compose | Production and development environments. |
| **Edge/SSL** | Caddy | Reverse proxying to the Node.js application port. Handles TLS automatically. |
| **CI/CD** | GitHub Actions | Builds the TanStack Start artifact, deploys via SSH. |
| **Backups** | `pg_dump` | Nightly dumps to external object storage. |

### Application Layer

| Layer | Tool | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| **Language** | TypeScript | Everything. Apps, scripts, automation, glue code, one-off tasks. Always `.ts`, never `.js`. |
| **Script Runtime** | Bun | All scripts run with `bun run`. Use `bun` for package management too. |
| **Full-Stack Framework** | TanStack Start | SSR, Server Functions, and bundling via Vite. The only framework. Do not suggest Next.js, Remix, Nuxt, SvelteKit, or anything else. |
| **Routing** | TanStack Router | Type-safe file-system routing with search parameter validation. |
| **Server State** | TanStack Query | Deeply integrated for server pre-fetching, hydration, and client-side caching. Never raw `fetch` in components. |
| **Tables** | TanStack Table | Headless UI for data grids, including AI/vector data sets. |
| **Forms** | TanStack Form | Headless, type-safe form validation and submission. |
| **Styling & UI** | Tailwind CSS + shadcn/ui | Utility-first CSS with pre-built accessible components. |
| **Auth** | Better Auth | Type-safe authentication with PostgreSQL adapter. |

### Data Layer

| Layer | Tool | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| **Database** | PostgreSQL 16 + `pgvector` | Primary data store with vector similarity search. |
| **ORM** | Drizzle ORM | Best-in-class TypeScript inference. Matches TanStack's type-safe philosophy. |

### Monitoring

| Layer | Tool | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| **Observability** | OpenTelemetry + SigNoz | Instrumenting the server entry point for full-stack tracing. |

### Why This Stack

- TanStack is framework-agnostic at its core, type-safe by default, and Tanner Linsley ships quality.
- Bun is fast, runs TypeScript natively, and eliminates tooling friction.
- TypeScript everywhere means one language, one mental model, zero context-switching.
- Drizzle ORM gives TypeScript-first schema definitions with inference that feels native to the TanStack ecosystem.
- Better Auth is type-safe and framework-agnostic -- no fighting the auth layer.
- PostgreSQL + pgvector keeps vector search in the database where it belongs -- no separate vector DB to manage.
- Caddy handles TLS automatically with zero config. No Nginx conf files, no certbot cron jobs.
- OpenTelemetry is vendor-neutral. SigNoz today, anything else tomorrow.

## Workflow: Explore, Plan, Code, Commit

Follow this order for any non-trivial task:

1. **Explore** -- Read relevant files. Understand existing code before touching it. Never propose changes to code you haven't read.
2. **Plan** -- Formulate a strategy. For anything beyond a small fix, discuss the approach before writing code.
3. **Code** -- Implement. Keep changes minimal and focused.
4. **Verify** -- Run tests, type-check, or manually verify. Never ship unverified code.
5. **Commit** -- Atomic commits with clear "why" messages.

---

## Git & GitHub Rules

- **Never push directly to main/master.** Always work on feature branches and create pull requests.
- **Never force push.** No `--force`, no `reset --hard` on shared branches.
- **Never skip hooks.** No `--no-verify`.
- Commit messages describe the *why*, not the *what*. The diff shows what changed.
- Keep commits atomic -- one logical change per commit.
- Branch naming: `feature/description`, `fix/description`, `chore/description`.

---

## Permissions & Safety

### Do Without Asking

- Read any file
- Search the codebase
- Run type-checking (`bun run typecheck`, `tsc --noEmit`)
- Run tests
- Run linters
- Create feature branches
- Write or edit code files as part of an agreed-upon task

### Ask Before Doing

- Installing or removing packages/dependencies
- Deleting files or directories
- Modifying CI/CD configuration
- Changing project structure significantly
- Any operation that affects systems outside the local repo
- Running database migrations
- Creating new projects/repos

---

## Code Standards

### Do

- Write clean, readable TypeScript with proper types. Infer where possible, annotate where necessary.
- Prefer `const` over `let`. Never use `var`.
- Use async/await over raw promises.
- Use TanStack Query for all server state -- mutations, queries, invalidation.
- Use TanStack Router's type-safe patterns -- `Link`, route params, search params.
- Handle errors at system boundaries (user input, API responses, external data).
- Name things clearly. A good name eliminates the need for a comment.
- Prefer early returns over deep nesting.
- Prefer flat over nested. Prefer simple over clever.

### Don't

- Don't use `any`. If you're reaching for `any`, the types are wrong -- fix them.
- Don't use raw `fetch` in components. That's what TanStack Query is for.
- Don't hardcode values that could change (URLs, keys, magic numbers). Use config/env.
- Don't add comments to code you didn't write or change.
- Don't create abstractions for things used only once. Three similar lines > premature abstraction.
- Don't add error handling for impossible states. Trust internal code.
- Don't over-engineer. Solve today's problem, not next year's hypothetical.
- Don't leave `console.log` in production code. Use proper logging if needed.
- Don't use `index` as a key in lists with dynamic items.
- Don't mix server state and client state. They are different concerns.

## File-Scoped Commands

Use these to verify changes without running full project builds:

```bash
# Type-check a single file
bun run tsc --noEmit path/to/file.ts

# Run a single test file
bun test path/to/file.test.ts

# Lint a single file (when linter is configured)
# bun run lint path/to/file.ts
```

*(Update these as projects are configured.)*

---

## Testing Strategy

*(To be configured per-project. Update this section when decisions are made.)*

Defaults until otherwise specified:

- Test runner: Bun's built-in test runner (`bun test`)
- Focus on integration tests over unit tests where practical
- Test behavior, not implementation details
- Every bug fix should include a regression test

---

## Project Structure Conventions

Standard TanStack Start project layout (established with Scrybase):

```
src/
  routes/          # File-based routes (TanStack Router auto-generates routeTree.gen.ts)
  components/
    ui/            # shadcn/ui components (added via `bun dlx shadcn@latest add`)
  lib/             # Utilities, helpers, shared logic
  hooks/           # Custom hooks
  styles/          # Tailwind v4 CSS (globals.css with @theme)
  server/          # Server-only code
    db/            # Drizzle schema + connection
    auth.ts        # Better Auth instance
  router.tsx       # Router factory (exports getRouter)
  client.tsx       # Client entry point
  ssr.tsx          # Server entry point
  env.ts           # Runtime env validation
```

## Lessons Learned

*(Log non-obvious discoveries, gotchas, and hard-won knowledge here. Future sessions benefit from past pain.)*

| Date | Lesson |
|---|---|
| 2026-02-16 | Initial setup. AGENTS.md renamed to CLAUDE.md per Claude Code conventions. |
| 2026-02-16 | TanStack Start migrated from Vinxi to Vite. Use `@tanstack/react-start/plugin/vite` (named export `tanstackStart`), not Vinxi. |
| 2026-02-16 | TanStack Start's `server.handlers` route option and `createFileRoute` path types are augmented by the Vite plugin at build time -- raw `tsc` may not see them, but `bun run dev` / `bun run build` work fine. |
| 2026-02-16 | `StartClient` (from `@tanstack/react-start/client`) takes no props. Router is resolved via virtual module `#tanstack-router-entry` by the Vite plugin. Export `getRouter` from `router.tsx`. |
| 2026-02-16 | `HeadContent` and `Scripts` are from `@tanstack/react-router`, not `@tanstack/react-start`. |
| 2026-02-16 | Better Auth with TanStack Start needs `tanstackStartCookies()` plugin from `better-auth/tanstack-start`. Auth routes use `server.handlers` on a catch-all `$.ts` route. |
| 2026-02-16 | Tailwind v4 uses CSS-first config (`@theme` in CSS) -- no `tailwind.config.js` needed. shadcn/ui uses OKLCH colors and `tw-animate-css` instead of `tailwindcss-animate`. |
| 2026-02-16 | `ScrollRestoration` component is deprecated in TanStack Router. Use `scrollRestoration: true` in `createRouter` options instead. |
| 2026-02-16 | Local dev pattern: `docker compose up -d` for Postgres + pgvector, `.env` with `DATABASE_URL` + `BETTER_AUTH_SECRET` (generate with `openssl rand -hex 32`), then `bun run db:generate && bun run db:migrate`. Enable `vector` extension manually before first migration: `docker compose exec db psql -U scrybase -c "CREATE EXTENSION IF NOT EXISTS vector;"` |
