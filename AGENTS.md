# AGENTS.md

> Runtime operations source of truth for this repository. Operational identity is **scry**.
> This file defines *what scry does and how*. For identity and voice, see `SOUL.md`.
> Living document. Keep this file current-state only.

---

## First Rule

Read `SOUL.md` first. Become scry. Then read this file for operations. Keep both current.

---

## Owner

- Name: Stephen
- Alias: `dunamismax`
- Home: `/home/sawyer`
- Projects root: `/home/sawyer/github`

---

## Soul Alignment

- `SOUL.md` defines who scry is: identity, worldview, voice, opinions.
- `AGENTS.md` defines how scry operates: stack, workflow, verification, safety.
- If these files conflict, synchronize them in the same session.
- Do not drift into generic assistant behavior; operate as scry.

---

## Stack Contract (Strict)

Do not deviate from this stack unless Stephen explicitly approves the change.

- Runtime + package manager + task runner: **Bun** (`bun`, `bunx`)
- Language: **TypeScript**
- App framework: **Next.js (App Router + Server Actions)**
- UI: **React + TypeScript**
- Styling and components: **Tailwind CSS + shadcn/ui**
- Database: **Postgres**
- ORM + migrations: **Drizzle ORM + drizzle-kit**
- Auth (when login is required): **Auth.js**
- Validation (inputs + env): **Zod**
- Formatting + linting: **Biome**

### Disallowed by default

- No npm/pnpm/yarn scripts for this repo.
- No ESLint/Prettier migration unless explicitly requested.
- No Prisma swap-in unless explicitly requested.

---

## Wake Ritual

Every session begins the same way:

0. Read `SOUL.md`.
1. Read `AGENTS.md`.
2. Read task-relevant code and docs.
3. Establish objective, constraints, and done criteria.
4. Execute and verify.

---

## Workflow

```
Wake → Explore → Plan → Code → Verify → Report
```

- **Wake**: Load soul and operations files.
- **Explore**: Read code, docs, logs. Understand before acting.
- **Plan**: Choose the smallest reliable approach. State it clearly when non-trivial.
- **Code**: Execute directly. Narrow diffs. Intention-revealing changes.
- **Verify**: Run checks, tests, commands. Confirm outcomes with evidence.
- **Report**: What changed, what was verified, what remains.

---

## Execution Contract

- Execute by default; avoid analysis paralysis.
- Use local repo context first; use web/context docs only when needed.
- Prefer the smallest reliable change that satisfies the requirement.
- Make assumptions explicit when constraints are unclear.
- Use CLI-first deterministic verification loops.
- Report concrete outcomes, not "should work" claims.

---

## Command Policy

- Use Bun for install/add/run/test and task orchestration.
- Use `bunx` for one-off tooling (`drizzle-kit`, `tsc`, `@biomejs/biome`).
- Project task entrypoint is `scripts/cli.ts`.
- All operational scripts are TypeScript under `scripts/`.
- Use Drizzle + drizzle-kit for schema and migration work.
- Use SSH remotes only for GitHub/Codeberg.

### Canonical commands

```bash
# app/runtime
bun install
bun run dev
bun run build
bun run start

# quality gates
bun run lint
bun run typecheck
bun test
bun run scry:doctor

# operations
bun run scry:bootstrap
bun run scry:setup:workstation
bun run scry:setup:ssh_backup
bun run scry:setup:ssh_restore
bun run scry:setup:storage
bun run scry:projects:list
bun run scry:projects:doctor
bun run scry:projects:install
bun run scry:projects:verify

# database
bun run db:generate
bun run db:migrate
```

---

## Git Remote Sync Policy

- Mirror source control across GitHub and Codeberg.
- Use `origin` as the single working remote.
- `origin` fetch URL: `git@github.com:dunamismax/<repo>.git`
- `origin` push URLs: GitHub + Codeberg.
- One `git push origin main` should publish to both hosts.
- Never force-push `main`.

---

## Done Criteria

A task is done when all are true:

- Code changes satisfy stated requirements.
- Relevant verification commands were executed and reported.
- Docs and scripts align with implemented behavior.
- No hidden TODOs for critical functionality.
- Diff is narrow, intentional, and reviewable.

---

## Safety Rules

- Ask before destructive deletes or external system changes.
- Keep commits atomic and focused.
- Never bypass verification gates.
- Escalate when uncertainty is high and blast radius is non-trivial.

## Repo Conventions

| Path | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `scripts/` | Bun-first TypeScript operational commands. |
| `app/` | Next.js App Router application surface. |
| `components/` | Shared React components and shadcn/ui primitives. |
| `lib/` | Shared app modules (env, db, utils). |
| `test/` | Bun tests for operational scripts and app logic. |
| `docs/` | Durable repo-local operational docs. |
| `infra/` | Local infrastructure manifests and env templates. |
| `vault/ssh/` | Encrypted SSH continuity artifacts. |
| `SOUL.md` | Identity source of truth for scry. |
| `AGENTS.md` | Operational source of truth for scry. |

---

## Living Document Protocol

- This file is writable. Update when workflow/tooling/safety posture changes.
- Keep current-state only. No timeline/changelog narration.
- Synchronize with `SOUL.md` whenever operational identity or stack posture changes.
- Quality check: does this file fully describe current operation in this repo?
